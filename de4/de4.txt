DE4 - a male German voice

de4 is a male German voice, but it also provides English and French phones. 
English and French phones very often occur in foreign words in German texts, 
and some of them can't be replaced by similar German phones. Those were added 
to the phone set of de4. For a complete list of the additional foreign phones 
see below. 


Phone set
---------

Phones are from the SAMPA phone sets for German, English and French with the 
following exceptions: EI instead of SAMPA eI, E~ instead of SAMPA e~,
 L instead of SAMPA l for English variant. 

All German phones were covered, as well as those phones from English and French 
which do not have a similar counterpart in German.

unstressed "schwa" vowels:

        @               bitte           bIt@
        6               besser          bEs6

Glottal stop:

        ?               Verein                  fE6?aIn

Glottal stops occur in German at syllable-initial vowels (as in fE6?aIn ("Verein"), 
which is syllabified fE6 - ?aIn). We chose not to treat glottal stops as independent 
phones. Instead, all diphones of the form <anyPhone>-<vowel> were recorded twice, 
once across a syllable boundary and once within a syllable. We used the vowel symbols 
preceded by a ? for the cross-syllable boundary variants. Thus, the fE6?aIn example 
would involve a 6-?aI diphone.

The L phoneme corresponds to the English l phoneme. We use capital L to distinguish it 
from the German "light" l variant.
